# spam_phone_calls

Our government and judiciary has continuously failed to safeguard us whether it is about unethical business practices like BYJUS, Betting Apps or fake influencer marketings or pesky automated unwanted calls. Everything is working against common man to rob him from his precious time, attention and money. In turn keeping us country devoid of attention and innovation. We should try to take it in our own hands and solve it one by one. 

And this repo is dedicated to one such problem -> Unwanted Calls
Motivation behind this step is 10's of unwanted call that I get everyday, calls offering me credit card, loans, crappy Data Science courses or many other things. 
I keep on blocking every such calls every day and next day new number appears. 
Truecaller does an amazing job of identifying those calls for me. But I dont' want to just identify but also block all such calls. Peace.  
- The first step of this approach is to find out a way to identify and block all automated all.
- Second step is to identify and block manual spam calls 

The goal is to create a crowdsourced repository of spam phone numbers. 
So that people can use it to block it and avoid unnecessary interruption in their daily lives.
